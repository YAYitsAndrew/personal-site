a13o is Andrew Pellerano.

I use this space to publish my thoughts and ideas to the world.

I don't write here often, a topic must really be burning in my mind for me to collect my thoughts in essay form.

There's no publishing cadence and there never will be. The best way to passively follow along is to use this site's <a href="/feed.xml">RSS</a> feed.
