a13o is Andrew Pellerano.

I use this space to publish my thoughts and ideas to the world. I'm interested in helping to solve the internet's growing pains, which have created tribal rifts in our society. I believe that people will look back at this era as a dark ages or a wild west. It is then our generation's job to bring civility to the digital homestead.

Previously I spent a decade in the games industry. I think my expertise in experience design in that space can provide structure and positive incentives to some of today's biggest problems.

I don't write here often, a topic must really be burning in my mind for me to collect my thoughts in essay form. When I do write, be it essays or software, it will get posted here.
